# LESSONS.md — error record (feeds the dev-method)

A queue, not an archive: when something breaks or surprises us, it gets a short
entry here. Dev-method skill sessions harvest routed entries into skill/GI
updates and mark them `HARVESTED — <date>` (or delete them).

## 2026-07-11 — Browser import maps are invisible to the Node test suite

- What broke / what happened: the planned import map (`"three"` →
  `./lib/three.module.js`) would have left every `src` module unimportable by
  the committed Node suite — bare `'three'` doesn't resolve in Node. Caught at
  shell-pass build time, before delivery.
- Root cause: import maps are a browser-only resolution mechanism; the
  module-health suite runs in Node.
- Verification gap it exposed: none shipped — designing the suite first is what
  surfaced it.
- Plug shipped: relative imports everywhere (`../lib/three.module.js`);
  DESIGN.md v1.1 records the decision; the suite exercises the real import
  chain on every run.
- Route: skill reference (html-game.md) candidate — "vendored ES-module libs:
  prefer relative imports over import maps when a committed Node import suite
  exists."

## 2026-07-11 — NaN light intensity blacks out every lit material (unlit survives)

- What broke / what happened: the first shot set `flashLight.intensity` from a
  CONFIG constant that wasn't in the running file (the paste-in hadn't landed
  at CONFIG's top level) → `undefined` → NaN in the lighting sum → every
  `MeshStandardMaterial` surface rendered black, INCLUDING emissive targets;
  the unlit `GridHelper` survived. The flash quad froze at full opacity because
  its fade branch is `flashT < CONFIG.FLASH_MS` and `0 < undefined` is false.
  Zero console errors, zero exceptions.
- Root cause: code reading config keys that didn't exist in the running module;
  NaN propagates silently through GPU lighting.
- Verification gap it exposed: "the suite catches a bad paste" was only true
  for SYNTAX damage — a paste that lands in the wrong block, or never lands,
  parses fine and sails through. The suite proved the file parsed, not that
  the constants existed.
- Plug shipped: suite Section 5 — a config schema (every required key present,
  numbers finite, strings non-empty, STREAK_TIERS descending; extend when
  adding constants) PLUS a text scan of every literal `CONFIG.<path>` read
  across src (including main.js), failing any that don't resolve; a ≥15-reads
  floor guards the scanner itself. Proven to fire on the exact incident
  (deleting FLASH_INTENSITY fails twice, naming the reading file).
- Route: skill reference (html-game.md) candidate — extends the existing
  "Canvas draws nothing on NaN coordinates" diagnostic to WebGL: *scene
  suddenly black but unlit materials (grid/line/basic) still visible = a NaN
  light uniform; check the last-touched light value first.* Corollary:
  paste-in config edits need an existence probe, not just a parse.

## 2026-07-11 — the missing-key class struck twice: config (again) and its registry twin was still open
- What broke / what happened: first W press → black screen, HUD/reticle
  alive, zero console errors. The movement config paste
  (PLAYER.MOVE_SPEED / WALL_MARGIN / BODY_RADIUS) hadn't landed →
  `speedMps` undefined → NaN camera position → NaN view matrix. Suite
  Section 5 (built from the NaN-light incident) named all three keys on
  its first run and the fix was one paste. Bonus find in the same suite
  output: `DEBUG: { SPAWN_ZOMBIE: true }` still present — the pass-5a
  retirement edit had ALSO never landed, invisible because nothing reads
  the flag, but armed to fail the SHIP gate at deploy time.
- Root cause: the same class as 2026-07-11 (NaN-light) — paste-in edits
  are unverified landings; dead-but-harmless misses (the DEBUG line)
  evade even symptom-based discovery.
- Verification gap it exposed: (1) the registry-side twin was still
  open — the leaf sweep validates fields that EXIST; a MISSING registry
  field (e.g. BODY_RADIUS) NaNs identically and was invisible; (2) a
  RETIRED config key has no guard at all — nothing asserts absence.
- Plug shipped: enemy-registry required-keys schema in Section 5
  (28 numeric fields per type, extend with the registry), negative-
  tested by name (`proto_zombie.BODY_RADIUS got undefined`, exit 1).
  Retired-key absence remains unguarded — accepted: the SHIP gate
  catches truthy DEBUG leftovers, and stale keys are inert by
  convention (config is read-only via CONFIG.<path> scans).
- Route: dev-method candidate — after any paste-in edit, run the suite
  BEFORE playing (testing step 1 exists precisely for this class); a
  diagnostic signature earns its keep the second time it fires.
